A new critical (yet optional) X.509 extension could be used to restrict the service in which signatures may be bound. Since the service OID may be specified in the TXT record, it may be set in zero-to-many certificates, and it must be set in the signature metadata, all OIDs must match, or else the signature bundle will fail validation.\n- Member attribution. If the SignedData signer is a member, and the member attribution field in the signature metadata is specified, then they must match, or else verification will fail.\n- Service-specific metadata. A new critical (yet optional) X.509 extension could be used to restrict how the service can be used, using a key/value map whose keys and values are entirely service-dependant. For example, Kliento could use this to restrict where tokens can be used (the \"audience\").",
