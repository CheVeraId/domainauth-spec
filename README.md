# DomainAuth Version 1

This is the working area for the Internet-Draft (I-D) "DomainAuth Version 1", the protocol underpinning [VeraId](https://veraid.net/).

Refer to [`rationale.md`](./rationale.md) for additional context on key design decisions.

## Conventions

- British spelling is to be used (e.g. "organisation", "serialisation") for consistency with the original draft.
- The abbreviation for "identifier" is spelt "id", not "ID"; it's an abbreviation, not an acronym.

## Usage

This project is powered by [I-D Template](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template), which is used via `make`.
